# TODO
* implement finding a cycle, think about the 2 different ways I've seen

# Idea
* rearrange packages and naming once I implement some directed graph algorithms?
like so

// import "github.com/teleivo/graph/undirected"
// undirected.Graph
// undirected.NewGraph
// undirected.NewGraphFromReader
// undirected.NewGraphFromReader
// undirected.DepthFirstPaths

// import "github.com/teleivo/graph/directed"
// directed.Graph
// directed.NewGraph
// directed.NewGraphFromReader
// directed.NewGraphFromReader
// directed.DepthFirstPaths

# Wishlist
* write recursive and iterative version of dfs and benchmark them
* visualize graphs
* generate a random graph
* find and showcase common applications of graphs with sample data that is freely available
* create a ParseError interface that returns the line, column causing the error
when parsing/constructing a graph from an io.Reader
