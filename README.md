Having fun with algorithms and datastructures üòÑÔ∏èüß†Ô∏èüòÑÔ∏è while learning Go.

## Resources

I highly recommend the following free courses

- [Princeton Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
- [Princeton Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

It took me way longer to complete them than suggested by Coursera. The course
was tough but simply beautiful ü§©Ô∏è. Take your time and enjoy the challenge. I
would also recommend reading the accompanying book `Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne`. The course website
[Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) is also a great resource to
visit again in search for an algorithm.
